Repository for further LD explorations

DifferentDepth_Simulations.sh - Input simulation parameters and data for sets of 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 reads are generated
Bin_ReadData.R - Seperates the read data into bins (currently, have to input each file seperately, should be modified to just take set name input)
Fit_Models.py - Fits models to the binned files (also needs to be modified to take set name input)
Run_Full.sh - Will eventually be used to generate, bin, fit, and plot a whole simulation
