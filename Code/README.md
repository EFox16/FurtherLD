# Fit_Exp

`Fit_Exp` is a set of scripts that fit an exponential decay curve to the linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures calculated by the ngsLD package. It utilizes the python package lmfit (Newville et al., 2016) to run a non-linear least-squares minimisation to fit the model to the data. The coefficients of the exponential decay equation and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for each data set are printed to the output file. 

### Exponential Decay Equation
LD = LD0 * e^(lambda * x) <--------------------Fix me!

### Usage
	% python Fit_Exp.py --input_type FOLDER --input_name /ngsLD/data/folder/ --data_type r2GLS --plot

### Parameters
* `--input_type STRING`:FILE or FOLDER
* `--input_name STRING`:name of FILE or FOLDER to analyse
* `--data_type STRING`:which measue of LD to analyse. options:r2Pear,r2GLS,D,DPrime. (the two measures of r2 are pearson calculations from expected genotypes and calculations from genotype likelihoods, respectively)
* `--plot`: OPTIONAL argument. will use an additional r script to generate a plot of each data set with the fit curve overlaid. 

### Input Data
This script will take files generated by running the ngsLD command. In this format, the first two columns are positions of the SNPs, the third column in the distance between the SNPs, and the following 4 columns are the various measures of LD calculated.
